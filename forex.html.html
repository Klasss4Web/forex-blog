                <h2>What is Forex</h2>
                <p>The foreign exchange market(Forex, Fx or currency market) is a global decentralized or over the counter (OTC) market for the trading of currencies. This market determines currency exchange rates for every currency. It includes all aspect of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or detremined prices. In terms of trading volumes, it is by far the largest market in the world.</p>
                <p>According to the Bank of International settlements, the preliminary global results from the 2019 Triennial Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and OTC Derivatives Markets Activity show that trading in foreign exchange markets averaged $6.6 trillion per day in April 2019. This is up from $5.1 trillion in April 2016. Below is the breakdown of the instruments traded and their respective volumes </p>
                <p>The $6.6 trillion break-down is as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> $2 trillion in spot transactions</li>
                    <li> $1 trillion in outright forwards</li>
                    <li> $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange swaps</li>
                    <li> $108 billion in currency swaps</li>
                    <li> $294 billion in options and other products</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The foreign exchange market assists International trade and investments by enabling currency conversion. For example, it permits business in the United States to import goods from European Union member states, especially Eurozone members, and pay Euros, even though its income is in US Dollars. It also supports direct speculation, based on the differential interest rate between two currencies.</p>
                <p>In a typical foreign exchange transaction, a party purchases some quantity of one currency by paying with some quantity of another currency.</p>

                <h2>Who Trades Forex</h2>
                <p>The forex market has different players of different types. Some of the major players in fx are discussed below</p>
                <h3>Commercial and Investment Banks</h3>
                <p>The greatest volume of currency is traded in the ineterbank market. This is where banks of all sizes trade currency with each other through electronic networks. Big banks account for a large percentage of total currency volume trades. Banks facilitate forex transactions for clients and conduct speculative trades from their own trading desks. When banks act as dealers for their clients, the bid/ask spread represents the bank's profits.Speculative currency trades are executed to profit on currency fluctuations.</p>
                <h3>Central Banks</h3>
                <p>Central Banks, which represents their nation's government, are extremely important players in the forex markets. Open market operations and interest rate policies of central banks influences currency rates to a large extent. A central bank is responsible for fixing the price of its country's native currency. Any action taken by a central bank in the forex market is done to stabilize or increase the competitiveness of that nation's economy</p>
                <h3>Investment Managers and Hedge Funds</h3>
                <p>Portfolio managers, poole funds and hedge funds make up the second-biggest  collection of players in the forex market next to commercial banks and central banks. Investment managers trade currencies for large accounts such as pension funds, foundations, and endowments.</p>
                <h3>Multinational Corporations</h3>
                <p>Firms engaged in importing conduct forex transactions to pay for goods and services. Consider a German solar panel producer that imports American components and sells its finished products in China. After the final sale is made, the Chinese yuan the producer received must be converted back to euros. The German firm must then exchange euros for dollars to purchase more American components. </p>
                <h3>Individual Investors</h3>
                <p>The volume of forex trades made by retail investors is extremely low compared to financial institutions and companies. However, it is growing rapidly in popularity. Retail investors base currency trades on a combination of fundamentals (i.e, interest rate parity, inflation rates, and monetary polarity expectations) and technical factors (i.e, support, resistance, technical indicators, price patterns).</p>

                <h2>Forex and Stock Trading</h2>
                <p>Technically, forex and stocks are traded in a similar way. However, there are some key differences between forex and stock trading. While Some traders prefer to trade only forex others prefer stocks alone and there are some categories of traders that trades both forex and stocks. While the underlying principle of these markets are similar, if you look closely, you would spot a huge difference between them in terms of actual operations. These differences would be covered in my next post</p>

                <h2>What do I Need to Start Trading</h2>
                <p>Forex trading is a skill and like every other skills, trading forex is like most other businesses in terms of requirements. Someone who wants to venture into forex trading would require knowledge of the market, a device(laptop,desktop or a phone) that can accept the trading apps/softwares,internet connection, an account with a registered broker and capital for trading. Although these requirements are all important, we are only going to cover the "broker" in this article and the others would be covered in future publications</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main section" id="brokers">
                <h2>Brokers</h2>
                <p>Forex brokers are firms that provide traders with access to a platform that allows them to buy and sell foreign currencies. Transactions in this market are always between a pair of two different currencies, so forex traders either buy or sell the particular pair they want to trade and it's the duty of the broker to set up the trades on behalf of his client (trader).</p>
                <p>Opening a forex trading account is usually quite simple and can be done online within a couple of minutes. Before trading, a forex broker require customers to make deposits into their trading accounts. However, the brokers also provides leverage that allows the trader take trades that are higher than their deposit or money in their trading accounts. </p>
                <p>Forex brokers makes money through commissions in form of spreads. Some brokers also make money through their own trading operations. This can be dangerous to their customers if it creates a conflict of interest which may be as a result of the broker trading against its customers although this activities have been reduced significantly by regulations. There are different categories of forex brokers and this would be covered on future publications on forex brokers.</p>
